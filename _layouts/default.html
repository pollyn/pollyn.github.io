    <h3><a href="/articles/henrys-statement">Henry's Statement</a></h3>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <p> I was born in the year 18 &ndash; to a large fortune, endowed besides with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of me.</p>

        <p> Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man&rsquo;s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the futherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering.</p>

    <h3><a href="/articles/a-fortnight-later">A Fortnight Later</a></h3>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <p> A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man&rsquo;s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety.</p>

        <p> To this rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire &ndash; a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a stylish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness &ndash; you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson a sincere and warm affection.</p>

    <h3><a href="/articles/business-table">Business Table</a></h3>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <p>Next they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor&rsquo;s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.</p>

        <blockquote><p>&ldquo;My head goes round,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He has been all these days in possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

        <p>He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor&rsquo;s hand and dated at the top. &ldquo;O Poole!&rdquo; the lawyer cried, &ldquo;he was alive and here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how? and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
